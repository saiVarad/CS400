Max was astonished to find out that he had won the local million-dollar lottery! 
Ecstatic, he gleefully collects the money and goes on a lavish spending spree. However, once
friends and family had found out about his good fortune, Max realized that winning the lottery
may not have been as great as it had initially seemed. Close friends and family relentlessly 
hounded him with sob stories and even threats, and even strangers started showing up and stalking him. His house was repeatedly broken into,
and even "accidentally" set on fire. Fed up, paranoid, and terrified for his own life,
Max decides to take matters into his own hands, before it is too late.
