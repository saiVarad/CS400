Max was astonished to find out that he had won the local million-dollar lottery! 
Ecstatic, he gleefully collects the money and goes on a lavish spending spree. However, once
friends and family had found out about his good fortune, Max realized that winning the lottery
may not have been as great as it had initially seemed. Close friends and family relentlessly 
hounded him with sob stories and even threats, and even strangers started showing up and stalking him. His house was repeatedly broken into,
and even "accidentally" set on fire. Fed up, paranoid, and terrified for his own life,
Max decides to take matters into his own hands, before it is too late.

codyknepprath paragraph:
To escape from his new reality of being pestered by everyone he knows, Max decides to buy a huge yacht and live on the sea. He lives out there for 15 years until one day he is captured by Jack Sparrow and decides to join his crew.

Kabiltan's paragraph:
Max was a loyal member of Jack Sparrow's crew for 20+ years. Max was such a loyal member that after 17 years he was promoted to vice captain. One day while the crew
was sailing they get caught in a storm like they've never seen before. Multiple bolts of lighting started to strike the surrounding ocean water. Max hurried to the deck
to pull down the sail. However this was all in vain because right as Max finished pulling the sail down a bolt of lightning struck the boat of Jack Sparrow's fleet and the ship sunk. Max was a great swimmer but he was powerless in the strong currents caused by the ocean. Max couldn't tell which way was up so Max slowly started to lose consciousness. The last thing Max remembers before he passed out was inhaling a large amount of water. When Max woke up he was with God in heaven. Max lived in heaven for the rest of eternity. The End.
